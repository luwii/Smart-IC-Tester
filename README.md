All kudos to Akshay Baweja - great work, it's a handy tool!<br>

Code changes I made is mainly to accomodate a different screen, and to compile it using PlatformIO and Visual Studio Code instead of the Arduino IDE. (And to show the IC number it's testing as it loops through.) The SD card and IC testing portions remain unchanged.</p>
