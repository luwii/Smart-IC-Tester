# Smart IC Tester
This is my variation on the Smart IC Tester project by Akshay Baweja https://www.instructables.com/id/Smart-IC-Tester/

You will need to read his original article before anything here will make sense. <br>

Code changes I made is mainly to accomodate a different screen, and to compile it using PlatformIO and Visual Studio Code instead of the Arduino IDE. (And to show the IC number it's testing as it loops through.) The SD card and IC testing portions remain unchanged.</p>

If you are looking for the original Gerber files for the shield, a copy is provided.
